### What's it all about?
In my country, Ukraine, people tend to name streets after famous figures in history, art, and science or after important historical events. Some of those personalities or events are recognizable at first glance, but sometimes you simply don't remember them. The second case is exactly my case, so I decided to create an interactive map web app that would allow people remind themselves quickly how those personalities looked, what was their occupation, why they were important in our history. Also, some streets might have their history and people can learn it when using this app.

It's not a commercial project, just volunteering work that was done to make history popular among people.
